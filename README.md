# HtmZetaOne

<!--
Zeta1 algorithm is a nonparametric clustering algorithm for sequences. 
Zeta1 clusters each point from a series under the following two assumptions.
- Compositionality
- Time invariance / Slowness

Since Zeta1 treats the learned clusters as random variables, Zeta1 can also be understood as Bayesian network.
The original paper by Dileep George is available [here](http://alpha.tmit.bme.hu/speech/docs/education/02_DileepThesis.pdf).
